kelly: here you go
michael: nice dress ryan
kelly: its not a dress its a kurta
michael:  ok
michael: tonight one of our most ethnic coworkers kelly has invited us all to a diwali celebration put on by her community what is diwali you may ask well to have kelly explain it  its ada blah blah blah its so super fun and its going to be great  lot of gods with unpronounceable names twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a hindu halloween
kelly: you look so handsome
pam: really you do i love the material
kelly: i know
michael: how come you didnt get me one
kelly: i
phyllis: ok so between merediths minivan and if i borrow bobs yukon that should fit about twelve people

stanley: i dont celebrate kwanzaa
michael: wha really you should its fun
michael: i love the people here and if there was one thing i di dont really care for is that they can be terribly terribly ignorant about other cultures and i dont want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend carol
michael: diwali is a very important holiday for the hindus but frankly im a little appalled that none of you know very much about indian culture so without further ado kelly you are on
kelly: um diwali is awesome and theres food and theres going to be dancing and oh i got the raddest outfit it has um
michael: kelly
kelly: sparkles
michael: um why dont you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday
