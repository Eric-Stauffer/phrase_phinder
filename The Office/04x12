michael: six years and two months
lester: and you were directly under her the entire time
michael: thats what she said
lester: excuse me
michael: thats what she said
lester: ms levinson told you she was your direct superior
michael: uh whwhy would she say that
jan: can we just move on to another question
diane: no wait i dont understand whos on record on saying this
lester: with all due respect im in the middle of a line of questioning now mr scott what did you say ms levinson said regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position

jan: okay if i may he was just telling a joke before so can we move on to another question
lester: oh are you sure
jan: uh yes
lester: can you go back to where this digression began deposition
reporter:  mr schneider: and you were directly under her the entire time mr scott: thats what she said
michael: well delivery is all wrong shes butchering it 

 
kelly:  yeah thats what i thought
lester: did ms levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired
michael: she thought it had to do with the twins thats what i call them
lester: can you be more specific who are the twins
michael: um to be delicate they hang off miladys chest they make milk
lester: you dont need to go any further her breasts
michael: yes
lester: she thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery
michael: yes and frankly the timing was nothing short of predominant
lester: what about your romantic relationship with ms levinson could that have played a part in her termination
michael: well if it did then the company is breaking its own rules
lester: interesting how so
michael: because before we started dating we disclosed our relationship to hr and i have the proof right here 
diane: okay the company has just a few clarifying questions mr scott if thats okay with you
michael: i will allow it
diane: um would you mind please just uh taking a quick look at uh this photograph please 
michael: uh
diane: that is you and ms levinson in jamaica is that correct
michael: uhhuh
diane: and that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship does that sound right mr scott the timeline here is actually very important please when did your relationship actually begin
michael: ugh well dedepends on how you define begin i mean if it was from the first time we shook hands thats like six years ago if its from the first time we kissed thats like two years ago
diane: wait excuse me
michael: if it was the first time we kissed sober it was like four months after that
lester: could we take a short break
diane: no uh are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in february as you previously testified to here
michael: line
diane: im sorry what
man: he asked for a line like in a play deposition
reporter:  mr scott do you realize you just contradicted yourself i did yes you did can i go to the bathroom no i really have to ive been drinking lots of water you went five minutes ago that wasnt to go to the bathroom that was to get out of a question you still have to answer it first can i go to the bathroom no
jim: good game meredith
meredith: dont patronize me
dwight: all right what is going on here
jim: dwight thank god youre here as it turns out one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master and i have to play him tomorrow or we lose the account can you help me out will you help me practice
jim:  what the hell
dwight: i told you
dwight: all of my heroes are table tennis players zoran primorac janove waldner wang tao jrg rokopf and of course ashraf helmi i even have a life size poster of hugo hoyama on my wall and the first time i left pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of andrzej grubba
michael: jan and i had an off again on again relationship for two years and i know this destroys her case and i am sorry but i throw myself at the mercy of the deposition diane
kelly: thank you mr scott thats all we needed to know
lester: wait wed like to enter to the record a page from michael scotts personal journal
michael: whoa whoa whoa whoa what are you doing with my diary
lester: this is plaintiffs exhibit 107 i quote from an entry dated janruary 4 of this past year just got back from jamaica tan almost everywhere jan almost everywhere hehe oh diary what a week i had sx with my boss i dont know if its going to go anywhere jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere that it was a one time mistake but we had sx six times so you tell me i am definitely feeling very eerie
michael: irie
lester: irie sorry more tomorrow xoxo michael it would appear that neither you nor ms levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word is that correct diane
kelly: were gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed
michael: i dont think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary diane
kelly: its basic discovery we have the right to review it
man: ok lets make ten copies of this diary
toby: um can you make it eleven
man: eleven sure and well break for lunch so everyone can have a look
michael:  can i sit here
toby:  you know i uh i know a little about what youre going through in a way um when i was a kid my parents got divorced they both wanted custody and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court so i dont know i didnt want them getting divorced in the first place you know i loved them both so much i just wanted 
michael: how can you give up my diary like that
jan: i had to im sorry but i need to win this we need to win this
michael: howd you even find it
jan: you keep it under my side of the mattress
michael: i dont like lump im really upset about this
jan: alright i stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer you emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company lets call it even
michael: fine i love you
jan: i love you too diane
kelly:  mr scott who is this other woman ryan who you refer to her as just as hot as jan but in a different way
michael: not a woman just a cool great looking best friend
lester: arent we trying to determine whether michael or jan were engaged in a romantic affair not michael and this ryan person
toby:  excuse me
michael: alright alright this is the way i see it yes i had sx with jan and yes i did consider jan to be my girlfriend however jan clearly didnt consider me to be her boyfriend so her actions are completely rightful diane
kelly: ok mr scott its its admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you
michael: thank you very much you didnt have to say that diane
kelly: considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews
michael: that was before our relationship she was going through a divorce and she was drinking a lot  of water diane
kelly: mr scott this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review would you mind uh reading the date on that please 
michael: march 17th diane
kelly: and that would be a month after your relationship became official is that correct
michael: yes diane
kelly: you may read the uh highlighted portion out loud if youd like to
michael:  i am out of carrots i am out of sticks mr scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee and a poor branch manager i recommend he be removed from that position and reassigned to sales where he belongs diane
kelly: mr scott after hearing that wouldnt you say ms levinsons judgment is at least very seriously flawed
michael:  diane
kelly: mr scott
pam:  hows it going
dwight: well he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable
jim: check this out though spin serve  well it works like 80 of the time so
pam: nice so should i reschedule the rematch with darryl now
jim: i think im ready
pam: ill make the call
dwight: wait a minute darryl is the client no no no he works here dumbass
jim: right spinserve 
michael: how can you do that to me
jan: 
lester: you can respond just remember its all going into the record
jan: michael i am not the enemy ok dunder mifflin is the enemy
michael: dunder mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect with loyalty they were going to give me your job and i should have taken it
jan: alright wait before you go any further let me show you what kind of loyalty they have ok lester please read that part of wallaces deposition
lester: starting at paragraph 6 council: mr wallace regarding michael scott was he a contender to replace jan levinson david wallace: yes
michael: see i was his number 1 contender i was being groomed
lester: council: was he your first choice david wallace: michael scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years
council: was he in the top 5 of contenders david wallace: what do you want me to say come on hes a nice guy there were many people that i considered council: was he seriously being considered for the corporate job david wallace: no
lester: i have one more question mr scott wouldnt you agree with ms levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees
michael: absolutely not
pam:  yes way to go  see that
kelly: yeah the floppy haired girl you date won a point
darryl: 19 serving 4 
kelly: woooh nice baby nice one  hey hey you you i dont like your boyfriend cuz cuz cuz cuz cuz he sucks at pingpong

michael:  hey david
david: yeah
michael: i think youre a nice guy too
david: thanks michael
michael: why did i do it i dont know jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary but she already brought the diary with her to new york so you expect to get screwed by your company but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend
