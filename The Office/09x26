i knew we were part of something different and new which is always thrilling and go ahead angela are you ready for the wedding yes i cant think of another thing that ive done for this long that is so important to me try that again i was on the set for this finale and i was looking around and i was just struck by the fact that theres no way you could assemble this type of cast again it was just my absolute pleasure to be a part of this show im really proud of what we did ive been waiting here for 45 minutes and the people are amazing whats great about the show is it is at the heart an optimistic show and i think that is its legacy are you with the office today its like being at a really cool party and then being the life of the party at that this is unbelievable you guys thank you for coming were pretty big in scranton were like 16 justin biebers when we go to scranton its like the pope and the beatles landing at the same time oh my god oscar this is the best day of my life oh my god michael scott this is the perfect time for this show to come to a close theres a finality to it and a sadness as well thank you thank you thank you it was simple it was just an office an office is a place where dreams come true very little happened at dunder mifflin they didnt really get much work done oh whoa very funny everyone conference room right now it is a quintessential american workplace comedy show it was awkward painfully awkward and hilarious how about the phyllisangela dispute you already did me thats what she said and you were directly under her the entire time thats what she said you always left me satisfied and smiling so  thats what she said michael weve all had a boss that gets in the way of you doing your job i just love how real it was we were everybodys experience at work your outfit what whats wrong with my outfit it celebrated those human interactions that annoy us all and make us chuckle or make us mad who put my calculator in jello i think thats what allows people to connect to the show because they can see themselves they can see their jobs they can see their relationships in this show welcome to the hotel hell checkin time is now checkout time is never does my room have cable the premise of the show when we started was what if you had the worlds worst boss and the irony was this is a guy who bought a mug for himself that said worlds best boss i think that pretty much sums it up i found it at spencer gifts the difference between steve carell and michael scott cant be overstated somehow we love them both equally real business is done on paper okay write that down hes so complicated im going to kill myself wow he had the sensitivity of a 5yearold youre sort of either going oh no i do that or youre going god glad im not like him and then you are like him relax pam stop pammsing michael scott was harmless and you had to like discipline him you idiot start over sir but you know hes a good guy i love it our show had such great characters that you didnt need anything to happen at all and it would end up interesting and funny hey why havent we ever  we have there are so many incredible performers in this show who are such gifted comedians it might be easier if you take a deep breath lift from the knees and shove it up your butt whoa dunder mifflin dwight schrute dwight has a streak of farm boy ubernerd and heavy metal white trash rock n roller ow dunder mifflin this is pam pam didnt love her job she didnt really love her love life and she wanted something more i dont think its many little girls dream to be a receptionist jim halpert jim isnt sure he wants to be in this job hes in love with a girl who doesnt know that hes in love with her so its this whole undercurrent of a guy who really wants something more hey kelly oh so jealous of your boobs kelly is superficial shes like a perpetually 13yearold mean girl because you already gave me a necklace oh my god i love it tell her how you gave it to me im not saying i had a meteoric rise but i did ryan is a schemer a dreamer he refuses to believe that he is destined for anything normal okay not to point out the glaringly obvious but doesnt the fact that im in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better you have your cats on nanny cam yeah i mean i usually try to take leave when i get a new cat but im out of vacation days and this company still doesnt recognize cat maternity angela loves cats she likes cats more than people for the most part i play lots of games just not at work you dont appreciate what im doing right now andy bernard aka the nard dog hes a sweet guy hes wellintentioned he has a good heart but theres a dark streak andy tried to run dwight over in the parking lot come on that i think was a nice metaphor for andy as a whole lot of bark and just no bite dwight are your legs broken no my right one is falling asleep a little bit andy are you all right go away tuna im winning this its the heart that kept people coming back the romance between jim and pam the loneliness that you saw underneath of michael scott i need a girlfriend so bad the aching vulnerable ambition of dwight i want the branch and i await your decision these are the little glimmers of emotion that keep you vested and interested there will always be a part of me that is defined by this character defined by this show and nothing can make me more proud oh look theyre starting ill never have a relationship with another actor the way i do with john krasinski i just wont it will be impossible if you have great characters and great writing you will have a great show and when the office was great thats why the original office was like my baby that i brought up and nurtured my name is david brent and ive always been in the paper industry yeah my parents owned a paper shop until it blew away paper it was a group of people thrown together that had nothing in common except they worked on the same bit of carpet eight hours a day youll never have another boss like me somebody who is basically a chilledout entertainer yeah im walking down the street going to see my agent i get a call on my mobile hi im ben sillman im an american just this  of words he went right im going to take the original office and were going to remake it in america i ended up tracking ricky down to a starbucks we had a fantastic twohour meeting i was excited and i was flattered i thought wow whats the worst that can happen lets have a go im like oh and its like oh so hats off to you im afraid the key to this type of show is the behavior being captured by the camera your ass is on the line mister and using long lenses to spy on things so what does downsizing actually mean and having people talk straight strait to camera i say bring it on so theres a lot of weird features to the show that were unusual perfect cover i can hear and see everything good we were going to go for steve carell for the role of michael michael scott how do you know where are you working dunder mifflin he was the best person for the job not only just brilliant everything he did was great he had great instincts nice guy he had that little intensity that sweet little shrew type face hes nearly handsome hes like bob hope you know what i mean oh my god john auditioned in new york there was a lot of pressure on him to audition for dwight but he really felt he should be jim can you just watch my phone thats a negative we brought them into our production office and ran improv games with them wed say heres the situation and they would just improvise the scene each one of these amounts to 10000 or more perhaps 20000 those can you roll back please does your chair roll can you roll back please i remember thinking when we doing the test my god this guy is legitimately annoying hed be perfect for this part because i was getting very frustrated as a person doing the scene i hear a lot of talking but im not aware of where its coming from i hear noises buzzing in the background but i have no idea where theyre coming from if this rings sure enough it worked out perfectly for our chemistry i hadnt done anything i was a waiter at the time waiting tables my favorite food is pomegranate there were seven jims sitting on a bench and i was the seventh jim and all six jims went in before me which was already a crisis seeing people who looked exactly like you can you say that with just enough sarcasm so i know its not sincere um my favorite food is pomegranate thats good very funny i knew that i had chemistry with john from the very first moment i met him at the audition what are you copying right now what is that this is dwights cats missing that is dwight cat wait missing persian thats his name by the way its not the type of cat i was pam beesly i was a receptionist i was a temp and dreaming about a different life im working right i dont know if youre working but i have work to do i do have work to do too excuse me sorry as soon as jenna walked in shes exactly what i imagined the part to be i remember very vividly i turned to her and said just so you know youre going to get the part she said thats so crazy because i thought youre going to get the part we shot the pilot and we shot five more episodes and then they were going to air them and the pilot got terrible reviews everyone compared it to the english show right off the bat and just was like this sucks and its terrible i had dreams of being brought before comedy court where they would say what have you done to this great show what is that thats my stapler no no do not take it out you have to eat it out of there because there are starving people in the world which i hate and it is a waste it was kind of a ratings disaster we didnt think we were coming back i knew we had a really special thing but i didnt know if anyone would watch it you cant do that why not safety violation i could fall and pierce an organ well see i think it was a weird show the type of comedy people werent used to watch this here you go i just thought that we were really pushing the envelope which was great that we were going to be doing something different im hitler adolf hitler who could not relate to the show the guy wants the girl but cant have her theres a weirdo working next to you and your boss is insane whats up but loveably hypnotic i still love that after seven years whats up whats up it was really touch and go and we really barely got a pickup for the next year this is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here four or five episodes into the season all of a sudden we looked and we were like number one on itunes tv shows being bought and downloaded everybody was like huh how does that happen we are a really low rated show and were number one on itunes unbelievable unbelievable so truly it was the itunes you know hits and downloads and all that that allowed nbc to see there was an audience for this so our fans totally created our show and then all of a sudden our ratings started just inching up inching up and then there was this big banner that was put on the side of nbc the office with all of our faces that was about halfway through season two and were like i think we got a tv show on our hands we are warriors i was doing letterman and i came out and people want me to sign autographs someone said whos that and they said he did steve carells role in the british version of the office i went thats true i did i did so i knew then that it was really standing on its own two feet the 63rd annual golden globe awards and then steve got nominated for the golden globe steve carell the office he was not expected to win and then he won wow i really did not expect this so i didnt write anything however my wife did and handed me something and when he won it felt like we all won im going to get teary talking about it it was just the best moment hi hey i was thinking about dinner i dont think jenna and i had any idea that this would become anything more than just a sweet relationship that you wanted to see on television click anytime john and i have gone to a restaurant together oh my gosh you see peoples heads explode yeah we walked into this restaurant we were going to have dinner and a woman came up to us and said oh my gosh you guys did it you got married in real life and i said no im married to a different man in real life who i have a child with we just work together im really excited to meet your mom you are they really want the show to be real and im glad your major and minor lines cross at a ridge that sucks at least i dont have cavities yes you have very nice teeth pam and jim started out as friends friends with feelings but over time jim really shows himself to be the caring and sensitive and thoughtful man that pam has been looking for how dare you it became so personal and so real for so many people because it almost looked like they would never be together i dont know mom hes my best friend i dont think i had ever kissed a girl on screen that was my first kiss on screen it was the first time jenna and i were ever doing a love scene because it was always these unrequited love scenes listen jim everybody was clapping after we finally kissed because we all really cared we were like were doing something right like something feels really really special we always used to say that everyone who watches the show thinks of themselves as jim and pam but are probably more like ryan and kelly i hope youre still committed because im pregnant bj and i have a very tumultuous relationship hey guys thats really inappropriate were best friends but in the writers room wed fight a lot but have a lot in common as well you lied about being pregnant right so you really dont understand why that might make me angry no were never getting back together why not we were sort of these always clashing soul mates on the writing staff and people were very amused by that and decided to write a ryankelly romance based on that its the best day of my whole life i made out a lot on the show what are we going to do i made out a lot with bj theres like big fights what im sorry im sorry im sorry then wed have to make out for years kelly was obsessed with ryan who took whatever he could get from her but gave nothing back 

  i am so cold its because you didnt bring a jacket you owe me three bucks for gas they were the couple that should not be having a work relationship because they cant let it not affect their work life ryan and i have a huge announcement oh my gosh over the weekend ryan bailey howard and i got divorced sweet free ring they were both pretty selfish selfabsorbed characters and they both had a common love for ryan they both thought ryan was the best lets do this thing hey the hidden affair between dwight and angela was a lot of fun yeah and turned into a fullblossomed romance where it was really like lady and lord macbeth these two kind of weird little power urchins dwight you should be running this office i loved it when she had a bobblehead made for him its me im the bobblehead dwight and angela were soul mates but then life happened he mercykilled my cat by putting it into the freezer it was beautiful and gentle and respectful and i fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep well she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out well im not responsible for that hey ow and that was it for dwight and i because he killed sprinkles this is sprinkles she was my best friend so they had to break up that sent angela martin on a rebound with andy bernard you may ask me out to dinner angela was a poignant relationship for andy because its the first time we saw him really just yank his heart out put it on his sleeve you looking for dinner and a movie because youre not going to find it in that box i think the scene where andy proposed to angela was very fitting because it was so leftfooted and just awkward miss angela martin will you please join me on stage okay then i will come to you my flower dammit angelas response was not good will you do me the honor of giving me your tiny hand in marriage it really summed up the tension the misunderstanding the denial all these awful things that kind of underpinned the relationship okay into the mike sweetie i said okay she said yes well the proposal episode was a crazy endeavor they built a rest stop and they had a huge rain machine the set was in the middle so trucks would go around to make it look like foreground highway traffic john and i stood out in the rain this pouring rain with these cars whizzing by us what are you doing i just cant wait oh my god will you marry me oh my god and it was so romantic so romantic you could just see the crew and the cast were just riveted to see what was going to happen next so yes you were so rooting for michael scott because he wanted love so badly and who would love such a weird guy i want the picket fence i want the ketchup fights and the tickling and the giggling jan was sort of the nightmare for michael on a path to destroy him that it dinner party episode man i would love to burn your candles you burn it you buy it oh good ill be your first customer youre hardly my first thats what she said and enter holly shes dj holly who also had this weird offbeat sense of humor that somehow was a perfect match for michael scott this is where i fell in love with you and this is where i ask you to marry me it started andy and dwight are rocking the sales team i feel very blessed first and foremost its a writers show and we really owe everything to the writers on this in an ideal world in an ideal world id have all ten fingers on my left hand so the right hand could just be a fist for punching its a troupe of people who understand writing and performing at the same time i spent more time here than i did on the set more time here than i did at home i definitely spent more hours here over the past ten years than anywhere else in the world and its not a very pretty place to be but there was a lot of laughter and a lot of great ideas oh come on its not real stanley dont have a heart attack oh no no no you will not die stanley you will not die stanley stanley barack is president you are black stanley im going to give him mouth to mouth no dont give mouth to mouth for this i think what makes the writing of the office so special is that it celebrates minutia it finds comedy in the smallest human beats of life it doesnt always look for big ridiculous moments which we certainly have our share of those what are you doing come on oh we started with the simplest premises that would happen in an office a new health care plan you work here dont you want good insurance dont need it never been sick perfect immune system a fire drill stay below the smoke line lets go clear out stat stat means now and then over time once the characters took on a life of their own the characters started dictating the story the only way to capture andy is to capture the extremes of andy one is when andy flips out and punches a hole in the wall ah then you have a scene where he is serenading angela with his a cappella group over the speaker phone  if you need me let me know 
 gonna be around if you got no place to go if youre feeling down  that is how sweet and hopeful and happy he can be those two things together are really the complexity that is the nard dog you dont need to stay here i know having a lot of emotional content in a comedy to me is great because the audience doesnt ever know what youre going for you could be going for a poignant moment and then you surprise them so youre pmsing pretty bad huh so much of the show is scripted i think it would surprise people they will script our looks to the camera it was just the acknowledgment to the audience that you know are you watching this did you see that am i the only one who thinks this is insane it was almost like jim had developed a relationship with the audience where he hopes that you saw it little ands and buts and ums are written into the script i think the reason why it looks spontaneous and effortless is how they shoot it the camera movements are choreographed we have handheld cameras that are moving and we dont have marks on the ground we plan all of that out beforehand everyone just works very very hard to make it look like its done on the fly ah ah we script it to feel very naturalistic and we always would have the last few takes be improvs wed say now you do your version of that where steve and rainn would lead the way and take it to these brilliant places do i stress you out nothing stresses me out except having to seek the approval of my inferiors the writers trust the actors enough to let us play with their lines and improvise off of them there was an episode i wrote for me and rainn called the initiation in which dwight takes ryan to his beet farm your journey begins now and i had written the script and put a lot into the script and it was early so i still thought that you couldnt improve on a great script i was planting the seed in the ground and that was the end of the scene then he said just as you have planted your seed in the ground i am going to plant my seed in you that was a line that i just came up with on the spot im like yeah this is cool i get to be a writer and an actor that improv was so much better than any other line in the script i had written it was just on the moment of course i would watch steve in a scene and i would see him get an idea i could just see a little twinkle in his eye that kissing scene with oscar is a great example of that you and i are going to make a statement together we kept hugging and hugging then one take he just kept coming in im like hes so close where is he im like oh i see what hes doing ugh the kiss wasnt supposed to happen that was improvised i can hear everyone laughing im like oh man i hope we dont have to do this again there he is oh no thats a male model one of the great things about the office is we just had so many wonderful guest stars i had been trying to push through timothy oliphant because i have a massive massive crush on him so much so that we dont believe that much on the show but he has an episode where he shows up on the office i would like to introduce you to mr danny cordray hes going joining us to be our new traveling salesman say hello to danny fck me okay you know what no no and we bleep it on the show for me that was really great that i could push through things like that pleasure to meet you ms bennett kathy bates is a toughtalking southern ceo sure are pretty dogs they love a great crotch they sure do you should take it as a compliment i do will ferrell was amazing i directed him in an episode of the show its like he fit in the world so well hi hello hi i remember in the writers room we obsessed with the scene in which he meets michael to beginnings and endings and to middles the unsung heroes the game of the scene was how long can these two idiots not realize theyre there to meet the other person hello this is michael scott yes hi youre running late no im here oh im at the bar im at the bar too you are what bar thats the kind of thing they were great at you give them a great premise they really buy into and see how far they can take it michael scott deangelo vicors wow bears eat beets bears beets battlestar galactica bears do not what is going on what are you doing jim is always pranking dwight michael oh thats funny michael if you look back on all the pranks its just really like getting his goat rather than actually hurting his feelings where is my desk that is weird and his desk is gone and dwight finds it in the bathroom dwight answers the phone still conducting business hes not going to let the location of his desk deter him at all jim will send a series of faxes from future dwight dwight at 8:00 am today someone poisons the coffee do not drink the coffee he believes it completely hes getting a fax from the future no youll thank me later thats one of the typical ones that has entertained audiences all over the world for so many years i think that all of these great pranks are the way that you would prank your brother my wallet oh there it is j1 dammit jim wrapping his desk in wrapping paper was incredible theres been many moments throughout the show but the whole thing you realize is based purely on love you know i have to do this i know at the end of the day i dont think jim would ever want to do something that actually hurt dwights feelings i can always block the blow i can counter it with i love our scenes at the art show when michael is the only person who shows up to pams art show wow that was so emotional and so sweet you want to buy it well yeah yeah we have to have it for the office i just love how kind michael is to her in that moment shes really very broken and he takes care of her and then we had that great talking head that is just my favorite the one where jim finally comes and asks out pam are you free for dinner tonight yes all right then its a date that made me cry its one of my favorite moments of the show im sorry what was the question kelly appeared in episode two of the office the episode called diversity day has michael insulting a minority googi googi time my googi googi googi i remember oh my god were doing that thing which is getting so close to you know real things that are genuinely issues that are terrible and the ignorance of people and youre doing it in a way that we can make fun of it based on stereotypes that are totally untrue i do not agree with you would maybe not be a very good driver oh man am i a woman i think my favorite episode of alltime is one called the injury i burned my foot very badly on my foreman grill he wants to wake up to the smell of bacon in the mornings this man wakes up every morning and plugs in a foreman grill goes back to sleep puts raw bacon on there and then eats it today i got up i stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot thats it i dont see whats so hard to believe about that he was angry it had happened to him and then he thought he was handicapped okay what does this look like to you stanley mailboxes etc that was really the office starting to hid its stride comedically when can i sit on your lap right now come on over big boy i will never forget the christmas episode where kevin sits on michaels lap michael is trying to get him to hurry up and make his wish what would you like for christmas little boy and steves performance was the funniest thing ive ever seen nobodys ever let me sit on their lap before you can see in the episode im in the background of that and i have to duck behind a wall because im just losing it what about if i tell you the things i dont want okay get off get off oh god michaels departure was very emotional and sad and i wrote that script the writing of it i was at one point crying to myself as he was writing the key moment between michael and dwight dwight i will be leaving tomorrow yes so i wanted to give you that its a letter of recommendation that was a really beautifully written and really fun to play moment of dwight reading his recommendation letter as a sales executive as a leader as a man and as a friend he is of the highest kind quality and order supreme and then the last scene that we ever shot of steves was jim going in and saying goodbye to michael and as soon as they called action  i started sobbing like an embarrassing amount of sobbing and steve started sobbing you know what i think we should do i think we should just save goodbyes for tomorrow at lunch you have these moments where the characters and your real life collide my last scene with steve even now its emotional i was directed to run after steve and when i got to him to just say goodbye and i said goodbye and we cried and we hugged and it was special because there was no sound so i could really say anything i wanted and it was private and it was our moment and it will always be very special to me hey meredith i need to tell you something oh my god meredith what are you doing baking a cake what does it look like im doing getting rid of the lice stop im so sorry i hope it holds up i turn on nick at night and see roseanne or i see everybody loves raymond theyre great seinfeld holds up years later you watch these shows and they still make you laugh and i just hope we are one of those shows i will be tossing this powerful insecticide grenade which contains piperonyl butoxide as well as i dont think anybody thought we would go over 200 episodes it is very emotional right now on the set everything is the last something we really fought long and hard a year ago to make this the last season lets commit to one final season lets do it right we had these incredible characters in this incredible setting and we wanted to see what happened to them to dwight this is a ring taken from the buttocks of my grandmother put there by the gangster patriarch of the coors dynasty melt in the foundry ran by mennonites okay yes i will i changed my mind again to andy i am going to leave dunder mifflin to pursue acting after all to stanley and to toby we wanted to see what else happened to jim and pam i dont know jim maybe you should have been there youre not serious right one of my favorite jim and pam moments is in our final season where they get in the fight over the phone i am trying to make everything perfect here okay so that you can have everything that you want im doing this just for me is that what im doing doing it just for me i hope that people saw the truth and the honesty in all of that rather than some crazy way to split up jim and pam talk to you tomorrow bye so those tears are real i didnt like jim being mad at pam any more than the audience did we forgot it was a comedy we forgot it was a tv show we just really cared not enough for me you are everything thank you its been an amazing couple of weeks to shoot the finale and you know as finales go theres always a lot of resolution for all the different characters and thats really really special for us the finale in time happens at least six months after the episode that just aired and there have been a lot of changes and theyre assembling for two purposes dwights wedding and for a panel thats been put together by the documentary crew thats been filming them it felt like we were doing the world and the characters justice and i hope fans agree but we put our hearts into it and im damn proud of it i think that you will be laughing and crying if youre a fan of the show its a really beautiful farewell cut im letting you all off half hour early to view the documentary so you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow or a minute extra for the rest of the month its a terribly heartbreaking because this show is like this wonderfully alive thing that were putting down i think the show will be remembered as something that was funny because it was true and honest about its characters and what they would do and what their lives were like and how they would talk and all its comedy came from that remember your exit points exit points people oscar oscar stay alive im getting help pull me up youre too heavy i only weigh 82 pounds i hope that in a few years that people have a moment where they yell save bandit i hope that you can dig out these dvds or whatever thing we use to watch things in ten years and that the show is still entertaining and moving and funny im all done thank you to the office  the wrap party we are thrilled to have you here i love you im going to miss this incredible family here so much this has been my other family for nine years are you for real right now i just have an overwhelming sense of pride and this is a huge part of our lives that is just going away and its a tough thing for me its just been everything its just been everything to me the greatest honor will be anybody making any sort of television or movie or art or whatever and saying you know i remember i was influenced and inspired by the office
