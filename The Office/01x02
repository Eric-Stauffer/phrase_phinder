michael: come on people lets get em in get in the cards get in the cards mr
brown: thank you thank you very much ok thanks for filling these out and i promise thisll be quick at diversity today our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations we believe that 99 of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance
michael: you know what this is a colorfreezone here stanley i dont look at you as another race mr
brown: uh see this is what im talking about we dont have to pretend were colorblind
michael: exactly were not mr
brown: thats fighting ignorance with more ignorance
michael: with tolerance mr
brown: no with more ignorance
michael: ignorance mr
brown: right exactly uh instead we need to celebrate our diversity
michael: lets celebrate mr
brown: right ok
michael: celebrate good times come on lets celebrate diversity right mr
brown: yes exactly now heres what were going to do ive noticed that
michael: you know what heres what were going to do why dont we go around and everybody everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually i will go last go
dwight: i have two white and indian mr
brown: actually id prefer not to start that way michael i would love to have your permission to run this session can i have your permission
michael: yes mr
brown: thank you very much and it would also help me if you were seated
michael: ok mr
brown: thank you ok now at the start of the session i had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace now what im going to do is choose one and were going to act it out
dwight: a few of the ground rules
michael: hey hey why dont you run it by me and ill run it by him
dwight: ok can we steer away from gay people mr
brown: um
dwight: im sorry its an orientation its not a race plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays soparadox mr
brown: well we only have an hour
dwight: i figured it would save time
michael: ok why dont we just defer to mr mr
brown: mr brown
michael: ah oh right ok first test i will not call you that mr
brown: well its my name its not a test ok um so looking through the cards ive noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident which is ironic because its the exact incident i was brought in here to respond to now how many of you are familiar with the chris rock routine very good ok
michael: how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and groundbreaking and then i go and do the exact same routine same comedic timing and people file a complaint to corporate is it because im white and chris is black mr
brown: so were going to reenact this with a more positive outcome
michael: i will play the chris rock guy i would like to see someone else pull this off mr
brown: well lets have someone who wasnt involved in the reenactment
michael: ok i will play guy listening mr
brown: great guy listening ok anyone else remember
kevin: i remember mr
brown: great youre the chris rock guy and youre guy listening
michael: ok
michael: kevin is a great guy hes a great accountant he is not much of an entertainer
kevin: basically there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people every time the one type wants to have a good time then the other type comes in and makes a real mess
michael: ok im sorry im sorry hes ruin hes butchering it could you just let me  every time every time black people want to have a good time some ignant ass  i take care of my kid mr
brown: wait a second
michael:  they always want credit for something they supposed to do mr
brown: stop it
michael:  what you want a cookie mr
brown: now this is a simple acronym hero uh at diversity today we believe it is very easy to be a hero all you need are honesty empathy respect and openmindedness
dwight: excuse me im sorry but thats not all it takes to be a hero mr
brown: oh great well what is a hero to you
dwight: a hero kills people people that wish him harm mr
brown: ok
dwight: a hero is parthuman and partsupernatural a hero is born out of a childhood trauma or out of a disaster that must be avenged mr
brown: ok youre thinking of a superhero
dwight: we all have a hero in our heart mr
brown: now i need you to take these forms this kind of expresses the joint experience we had today and i need you to look em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge
michael:  i dont think i can sign this mr
brown: i cant leave until you do
michael: well ok it says here that i learned something and i knew all this stuff already so i know i could sign something that says that i taught something or that i helped you teach something so pam where is she pam could we change something on this mr
brown: michael can i talk to you candidly
michael: sure mr
brown: we both know that im here because of the comments you made
michael: heres the thing this office i think this is very advanced in terms of racial awareness and its probably more advanced than youre used to thats probably throwing you off a little bit mr
brown: um its not throwing me i need your signature
michael: ok well i know you told me that several times mr
brown: yes but youre not listening to me yours is the only signature i need
michael: ok mr
brown: those are my instructions from the corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made the reason i made copies for everyone was so you wouldnt be embarrassed

brown: dont worry about dating
michael: i wont mr
brown: ok thank you
michael: yeah yeah 

 
michael: i regret my actions i regret offending my coworkers i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty empathy respect and openmindedness openmindedness is that even a word into the workplace in this way i can truly be a hero signed daffy duck  hes going to lose it when he reads that
