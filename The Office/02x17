michael: speaker at the sales convention been there done that went there again did it again two years in a row consecutive i just i miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it sir youre awesome heres a plaque what a whole year has gone by and you need more proof heres a certificate they stopped making plaques that year
dwight: what if i give a really long extended thank you for instance thank you mr blank thank you very very very
michael: that would look terrible these are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act
dwight: when i was in the sixth grade i was a finalist in our school spelling bee it was me against raj patel and i misspelled in front of the entire school the word failure
dwight: i cant do this
michael: thats because youre incapable of doing it because you dont know how because you have no skills dwight theres no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time
dwight: oh okay
michael: but i can teach you enough so that you dont embarrass me or the company
dwight: okay deal ill do whatever you say no questions asked
michael: well if you have a question you should ask me
dwight: ill try and think of one when
michael: dont dont try and think of a question to humor me just try not to be such an idiot
dwight: is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice
michael: insult

michael: yeah youre right about the difference between a man and a woman but not about the punch line to the joke right  the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman is boobs
dwight: hey do you remember the speeches that you gave
michael: i do both of them
dwight: could i have a copy of one of them
michael: no no they would remember them look it doesnt matter what you say it just matters that youre saying something that people care about yeah all right here we go watch this

jim: mmmhmm and the first thing they teach you is that youve got to be true to your self and you are all about authority
dwight: yes i am
jim: the great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers they were people of passion so if you want to do well today you got to do what they did
dwight: which is
jim: youve got to wave your arms and youve got to pound your fists many times its supposed to emphasize your point
jim: ok i didnt actually major in public speaking but i did download speeches from some of historys famous dictators like this one  originally given by benito mussolini
