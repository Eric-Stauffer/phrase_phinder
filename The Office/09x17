pam: todd youre just saying insults in the form of an apology todd
packer: why cant i just be nice truth is i really like you guys i really do ok the apologys just half of it the big thing is making amends and thats why i brought these i went out to the steamtown mall and i got you all cupcakes from that place nipples

pam: hey hey guys wait before we accept these cupcakes i think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room dont eat the cupcake german

dwight: doesnt matter its a cemetery
jeb: yeah well im just saying its garbage soil thats all
dwight: well the only thing were planting here is dead bodies

minister:  would you want to do the honors
fannie: oh right uh you know i dont think we have to do this
dwight: we schrutes dont need some harvard doctor to tell us whos alive and whos dead but there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers and when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead out of kindness
oscar:  thats it for me 
pam: i dont think we should eat packers cupcakes we cant give him the satisfaction
phyllis: i agree even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so theyre dense but theyre also really fluffy
pam: we cant let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes he was awful to us and he still is how much is a cupcake 250 is that the price of our dignity
creed: 375 a cupcake actually 367 if you buy a dozen
creed: i never forget a number names in one ear and out the other places nope faces thats rich but numbers i have a gift i guess thats why im an accountant
clark: hey man i dont think weve met im clark todd
packer: oh im todd oh sorry for calling you a fat little runt earlier
clark: you didnt actually say that todd
packer: no wow im in this mode now where im apologizing for thoughts that are in my head  hey i have a crazy feeling  that you are really gonna like this
stanley: maybe we should eat the cupcakes havent we done enough to packer i mean we sent him down to florida on a prank  and you did fire him
nellie: i did i did yes and it was purely political he did nothing wrong
pam: would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from supermart
angela: do they even have a bakery anymore
kevin: they do its awful and its getting worse every day
pam: so it really is just about the cupcakes
andy: wow youre right it is just about the cupcakes

dwight: 
fannie: very funny ok oui oui oui
dwight: oui
fannie: oh my goodness
dwight: while everyone is gathered playing and singing sons  daughters people underestimate the power of nostalgia if baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport then i can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses second only to the neck
