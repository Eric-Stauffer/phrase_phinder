phyllis: we dont feel that way
angela: no not at all
oscar: you were the one joking around calling dwight a narc
michael: no uh no that was a test i was testing you and you all failed miserably when i said that dwight was a narc how many of you defended him how many of you said hey you know what hes right what hes doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs
dwight: thank you michael
michael: i am ridiculously antidrug so antidrug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion or testing of any kind
michael: drugs ruin lives people drugs destroy careers take cheech and chong everybody knows that cheech and chong are funny but just imagine how funny they would be if they didnt smoke pot i want everybody to take a look to their left now i want everybody to take a look to their right one of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives this year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children
