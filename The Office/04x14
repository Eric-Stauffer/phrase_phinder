pam: or in a great chair
michael: oh yeah maybe but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women
pam: i definitely remember your dinner party
michael: i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman  jan i think that fate put this catalog in my hands
pam: actually i put the catalog in your hands cause you have to pick out a new chair
michael: what is it like being single i like it i like starting each day with a sense of possibility and im optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results
