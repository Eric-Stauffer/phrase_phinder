jan: ageism companies they cant discriminate against people due to old age like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then ed truck your old boss threatened us with a lawsuit so we had to back off

toby: technically hes right
michael: hey shut up toby look why do we as a society hate old people so much

ryan: that is not correct
michael: ryan thinks that technology is the answer well guess what i just drove my car into a lake
oscar: you did what
michael: i drove my car into a  lake why you may ask did i do this well because of a machine a machine told me to drive into a lake and i did it i did it because i trusted ryans precious technology and look where it got me

phyllis: did you get any clients back
michael: maybe maybe not time will tell but i will tell you one thing those gift baskets never endangered anybodys lives  game set match point scott game over end of game
michael: everyone always wants new things everybody likes new inventions new technology people will never be replaced by machines in the end life and business are about human connections and computers are about trying to murder you in a lake and to me the choice is easy
ryan: im not saying i had a meteoric rise but i did and if they knew how much i was paying for my haircut now they wouldnt be giving me a noogie  it was two hundred dollars
