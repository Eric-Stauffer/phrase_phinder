dwight: next suggestion
michael: arrr dooby dooby do you need to do something about your bo
dwight: you need to do something about your bo
michael: ok i dont know who this suggestion is meant for but its more of a personal suggestion and its not an office suggestion far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody
toby: arent the suggestions meant for you
michael: well toby if by me you are inferring that i have bo then i would say that is a very poor choice of words
creed: uh michael he wasnt inferring he was implying you were inferring
michael: was i creed ok well you know what i am implying is that when were on an elevator together i should maybe take the stairs because talk about stank not that i would ever say something like that in public and i never have and i never will i just think its something that we should all be aware of ok now that weve learned this lets continue see this is good were learning and were figuring some stuff out you need to do something about your coffee breath
dwight: you need
michael: ok
dwight: to do something about
michael: shut up shut up shut up dwight ok i dont think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box
angela: sometimes you talk to us real close
michael: yeah is that hard for you alright well
angela: well when you have coffee breath
michael: ill work on that
angela: its hard
michael: lets keep going keep it going yep what do we have here we have somebodys piece of gum somebody put a piece of gum in there this is not a a garbage can this is the future of our company this is not a place for gum i dont wanna have to read these tomorrow

michael: that was deer gross oh
dwight: you liked it
michael: oh did not
dwight: jan have you ever had deer
