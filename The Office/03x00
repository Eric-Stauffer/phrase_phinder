oscar: well weve been trying to balance the books for a week now and for some reason theyre not balancing
jan: im sorry
angela: theres about 3000 missing and were trying to figure out where it went
jan: well its probably just some accounting error
angela: it is not an accounting error
jan: well it could be
angela: it is not an accounting error well its not my accounting error
kevin: this is the first ive heard of it they never tell me anything i like it that way
jan: obviously we do need to find it quickly to ensure that its not a criminal action
kevin: absolutely jan
jan: but i guess thats it so call me when you have news okay
oscar: okay
angela: michael said to stop by on your way out 
oscar: im pretty sure michaels involved because every other time theres been money missing from the office its always been michael except hes usually really obvious like hell say he spent 50 on a lunch with a client and hell submit a receipt from j crew
angela: are we absolutely sure its not an accounting error
oscar: i went over my books three times
angela: me too
kevin: has anyone in the office bought anything nice recently

phyllis: you guys wanted to see me
kevin: yeah
oscar: hi phyllis um were going over everyones expenses for the year its just standard procedure
angela: were missing 3000 and were trying to figure out where it went michael is the obvious suspect but he is the boss so we have to at least pretend to ask other people first
oscar: so i know the answers probably no but did you take any money or buy anything with company money or anything like that
kevin: oh my god
angela: i knew it
oscar: you did
phyllis: well about three months ago i was on a sales call and i broke the heel on my shoe and i only had the corporate card im really sorry
oscar: well how much was that
phyllis: 14

oscar: okay thank you phyllis
phyllis: okay 
angela: so is there anything you want to tell us about accountingwise
meredith: gosh i dont think so
oscar: were trying to find out who stole money from the company
angela: its better to be embarrassed by the truth now then to go to jail for it later
kevin: why dont we just ask her if she took the 3000
angela: idiot now we dont have the element of surprise its impossible to trap her and we wont be able to register the look on her face when we ask her if she stole 3000
meredith: you think i stole 3000
angela: oh we know you did or someone else did
oscar: did you use any company money for anything were just trying to balance the books

angela: kevin
kevin: does he get your 
angela: kevin you guys dont know anything
kevin:  roy and angela sitting in a tree kis
angela: kevin cut it out
oscar: we dont think it was you
kevin: no
oscar: but we have to ask everybody if you used any money to buy anything and forgot to report it or
roy: well i mean how would i do that even if i wanted to
kevin: you would have to take some from petty cash
roy: well i dont even know where that is
kevin: in oscars drawer

angela: we dont know that
kevin: oh come on
kevin: i didnt steal 3000 from petty cash i am not stupid if i wanted to steal from this company there are a lot of easier ways to do it for example i could seal peoples coats and sell them on ebay
angela: it obviously isnt dwight because he has the most integrity of anyone in the office  what did you talk to kelly
oscar: yes she said she didnt do it then 45 minutes later the conversation ended
kevin: i talked to creed and he said he didnt do it and then he tried to sell me dietary supplements

angela: no
kevin: no angela you never let me write accounting memos
angela: fine ill supervise

angela: okay yeah
oscar: its got to be it
kevin: oops um i took that and then i briefly lost it but then the pistons beat the cavs and so now im returning it all back go pistons but this is completely unrelated to the other 3000
angela: you gambled petty cash
kevin: yeah but i won didnt i
angela: thats not the point how are we supposed to believe you didnt take the other 3000
kevin: cause im telling you that i didnt

kevin: oh suspicious well how come angela suddenly has a new necklace all of a sudden
angela: my friend gave it to me
oscar: what friend
angela: diane chester snydburgh
oscar: what thats not even close to being a real person
angela: well its none of your business who gave it to me but i didnt steal any money
kevin: you guys this is stupid that were turning on each other that is exactly what they want us to do
oscar: who
kevin: the guys who stole the money
angela: all right you know theres only one more thing to do we have to investigate michael 
kevin: he is still in there
angela: yeah we know
oscar: basically were convinced that michael took the missing 3000 so were waiting until he leaves his office so we can go in and search for evidence when i say it out loud it really doesnt seem like a good idea
oscar: he said he was leaving right at 5:00
kevin: what time is it now
angela: you dont have a watch
kevin: its slow
angela: you cant look at the clock up there
kevin: well you cant just tell me what time it is

oscar:  not it
angela: hey wait  not it 
dwight: youre saying michael stole money from his own company
angela: well weve asked everyone else
dwight: no no thats insane it has to be somebody else like meredith or creed no meredith definitely
angela: we asked her she said she didnt do it
dwight: which is exactly what youd say if you did do it oh man i shouldve been handling this investigation from the beginning
angela: i believe she didnt do it are you doubting me
dwight: no
kevin: and here
oscar: oh my god
dwight: there has to be a better explanation
angela: how did he afford that new waterbed hes always bragging about
dwight: he charged it discover made a little cash back on the deal smart if he were a general in the army and you accused him without proof you would be courtmartialed in front of a firing squad
angela: thats not true
dwight: okay watch a few good men and tell me that thats not true i own it on dvd if you wanna come by later you cant handle the truth just kidding you can
angela: well dwight says that michael didnt take it but frankly i think hes hiding something  what
oscar: we uh we found it
angela: you did where
oscar: in your books
angela: excuse me
oscar: you accidentally logged this equipment depreciation twice
angela: well that doesnt sound like me
