michael:  david it was my understanding that i was not going to be managed
david: what gave you that idea
michael: it was my understanding
david: i see
michael: listen why dont we just leave that position vacant truth be told i think i thrive under a lack of accountability
david: look michael charles is very qualified get to know him i really think the two of you are going to make a great team
michael: but the branch is still mine

michael: youre not from paper
charles: no
michael: does david know this
charles: yeah he knows he just wants a good manager
michael: well that actually is an excellent segue into really what is my only point
charles: and what is that
michael: and that ii dont need to be managed charles and if you want pick up some tips observing here and take them to the other branches its all good but jan would mostly come by when she was super horny and ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry so are we clear

charles:  come in
jim: hey
charles: hey
jim: alright charles ive gotta be honest i think we really got off on the wrong foot here and truth be told im a pretty smart guy and uh a hardworker and a great number two for the office
charles: number two
jim: secondincommand to michael
charles: oh i didnt know that position existed
jim: oh thats because at first it was a made up position for dwight just to make him feel better assistant to the regional manager but then he lost that and michael gave it to me
charles: so youre the assistant to the regional manager
jim: assistant regional manager yeah
charles: any responsibilities come with it
jim: no not exactly
charles: so you keep this made up position its important to you
jim: alright i will um im just gonna let you get back to that
charles: yeah would you uh
jim: yep 
michael: hello stephanie ok where is he 
david:  michael
michael:  so is this the meeting youve been in all day
david: how did you get here michael
michael: i drove
david: ok
michael: cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party just pulled the rug out from under me and he said no figs ive already bought em and i dont have a place to store them so i feel like ive been sort of boned
david: michael listen
michael: do you talk to him about this youve talked to him all day obviously did you talk to him about this
david: well i didnt know about the figs specifically  
michael: ok then i dont get it it doesnt make any sense to me because i thought in the new system i was supposed to talk to charles and then charles was supposed to talk to you and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again
david: thats not exactly
michael: clearly thats what you wanted
david: no
michael: fifteen years i have been here and i have sacrificed a lot
david: yes
michael: ive put having a family on hold
david: we didnt ask you to do that
michael: and ive never gone hanggliding and ive never driven my car to the top of mount washington
charles: ok nice meeting everyone ill see you in a couple of weeks
andy: cool
dwight: excellent
angela: it was very nice meeting you charles miner
jim: see ya see ya  bye
jim: and for my next trick i will make my career disappear
kelly: i could see our kids facing obstacles being halfblack and halfindian but its so worth it you guys
phyllis: its just me here
kelly: i am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight
phyllis: i think he left
kelly: what move 
angela:  hello charles charles
kelly: hey is that his scarf
angela: no 
angela:  charles and kelly absolutely not he is a sophisticated man he does not need to go dumpsterdiving for companionship ok
michael: i dont understand that after fifteen years of service here i have to get in the car and drive to new york in order to talk to you that doesnt seem right to me that doesnt seem fair and i think that ive earned more than that
david: yeah youre right yes i get it i get it michael heres what im going to do
michael: ok
david: we will move some money around and i will personally see to it that you have your party you have your figs i will be in attendance its gonna be great hows that
michael:  i quit
david: what
michael: you have no idea how high i can fly
