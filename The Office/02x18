dwight: and they do your parents love you very much
michael: one more time  you
dwight: the schrutes consider children very valuable in the olden days the women would bear many children so we would have enough laborers to work the fields and if it was an especially cold winter and there werent enough grains or vegetables they would eat the weakest of the brood  they didnt eat the children
