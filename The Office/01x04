dwight: michael
michael: oh god dwight come on
dwight: i wanted to talk to you about the downsizing
michael: theres no downsizing
dwight: i but if there were id be protected as assistant regional manager
michael: assistant to the regional manager dwight
dwight: yeah so i dont have to worry
michael: look look look i talked to corporate about protecting the sales staff and they said they couldnt guarantee it if theres downsizing okay
michael: but theres no downsizing so just dont
dwight: bottom line do i need to be worried
michael: mmm mm mm maybe
michael: it looks like theres gonna be downsizing and its part of my job but blah i hate it i think the main difference between me and donald trump is that uh i get no pleasure out of saying the words youre fired  youre foired uh youre foired it just makes people sad and an office cant function that way no way  youre foired i think if i had a catchphrase it would be youre hired and you can work here as long as you want but thats unrealistic so
dwight: its a real shame cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through watercooler gossip than through official memos which puts me at a disadvantage because i bring my own water to work
stanley: whyd you do this
dwight: i didnt do it what do you mean oh the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance so what do you guys hear whats the scuttlebutt
michael: get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott now i think i have had a little stroke of genius in that i have had my assistant pam smile pam i have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it not bad not bad at all all right and the birthday person is drum roll please here we go who is the birthday birthday person
